## Description

This repository contains personal poorly maintained chocolatey packages.
Please raise an issue in case of any problems or requests.

## Etiquette Regarding Communication

I want to include the official communication notice here:

> When requesting support, try to remember that we are all volunteers that have lives outside of open source and none of us are paid to ensure things work for you, so please be considerate of others' time when you are asking for things.
> Many of us have families that also need time as well and only have so much time to give on a daily basis. A little consideration and patience can go a long way.
> Thanks for understanding.
